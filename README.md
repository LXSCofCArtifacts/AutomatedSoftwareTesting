# AutomatedSoftwareTesting

This project includes creating automated test cases for an open source project called Tanaguru Contrast-Finder, then displaying the results of the tests in a table on an html web page. The goal of this project was to create 5 test cases for 5 different methods, so 25 total tests. If the test passes, then you will see a green "pass" all the way to the right side of the table. If the tests fails, then there will be a red "fail" instead.
